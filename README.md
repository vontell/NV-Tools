# NV-Tools

This repository contains a collection of tools related to the Nitrogen vacancy center in diamond. More specifically, it contains a representation of the Nitrogen vacancy center, visualization tools, a pulse sequence simulator, and a state characterization module using Bayesian inference.

This work was completed during my SuperUROP at MIT within the Quantum Photonics Lab, and has been funded through the EECS department and Texas Instruments.
